Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs. This must include packaged apps such as the universal apps installed by default on systems.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows 10 Enterprise. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Run "PowerShell".

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-policies-deployment-guide

If the device or operating system does not have a camera installed, this requirement is not applicable.

This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) where the use of the camera is a local AO decision.

This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.

For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually disconnect the camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is a finding.

For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g., laptop camera cover slide) when not in use. 

If the built-in camera is not protected with a camera cover, or if the built-in camera is not disabled in the bios, this is a finding.

If the camera is not disconnected or covered, the following registry entry is required:

Confirm virtualization-based security (VBS) is enabled and running with Secure Boot or Secure Boot and DMA Protection.

For those devices that support VBS features, including Credential Guard or protection of code integrity, this must be enabled. If the system meets the hardware and firmware dependencies for enabling VBS but it is not enabled, this is a CAT III finding.

VBS, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.

For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon logoff, this is NA.

Virtualization-based security, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.

For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon logoff, this is NA.

For VDIs with persistent desktops, this may be downgraded to a CAT II only where administrators have specific tokens for the VDI. Administrator accounts on virtual desktops must only be used on systems in the VDI; they may not have administrative privileges on any other systems such as servers and physical workstations.

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Device Guard >> "Turn On virtualization-based Security" to "Enabled" with "Enabled with UEFI lock" selected for "Credential Guard Configuration:".

If data at rest is unencrypted, it is vulnerable to disclosure. Even if the operating system enforces permissions on data access, an adversary can remove non-volatile memory and read it directly, thereby circumventing operating system controls. Encrypting the data ensures that confidentiality is protected even when the operating system is not running. Pre-boot authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing encrypted drives. Increasing the PIN length requires a greater number of guesses for an attacker.

Windows 10 is maintained by Microsoft at servicing levels for specific periods of time to support Windows as a Service. Systems at unsupported servicing levels or releases will not receive security updates for new vulnerabilities, which leaves them subject to exploitation.

New versions with feature updates are planned to be released on a semiannual basis with an estimated support timeframe of 18 to 30 months depending on the release. Support for previously released versions has been extended for Enterprise editions.

A separate servicing branch intended for special-purpose systems is the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC, formerly Branch - LTSB), which will receive security updates for 10 years but excludes feature updates.

An account that does not have Administrator duties must not have Administrator rights.  Such rights would allow the account to bypass or modify required security restrictions on that machine and make it vulnerable to attack.

System administrators must log on to systems only using accounts with the minimum level of authority necessary.

For domain-joined workstations, the Domain Admins group must be replaced by a domain workstation administrator group (see V-36434 in the Active Directory Domain STIG).  Restricting highly privileged accounts from the local Administrators group helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation resulting from credential theft attacks.

Standard user accounts must not be members of the local administrators group.

Standard user accounts must not be members of the local administrators group.

Using applications that access the Internet or have potential Internet sources using administrative privileges exposes a system to compromise. If a flaw in an application is exploited while running as a privileged user, the entire system could be compromised. Web browsers and email are common attack vectors for introducing malicious code and must not be run with an administrative account.

Since administrative accounts may generally change or work around technical restrictions for running a web browser or other applications, it is essential that policy requires administrative accounts to not access the Internet or use applications, such as email.

The policy should define specific exceptions for local service administration. These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools that are used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.

Technical means such as application whitelisting can be used to enforce the policy to ensure compliance.

Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged and nonprivileged functions is greatly increased. 

All domain accounts must be enabled for multifactor authentication with the exception of local emergency accounts. 

Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);
2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and
3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.

The DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.
